## web scraper command line tool with image viewer, time limited

- get some list of image urls from the internet
- picks a random image from list
- displays that image the terminal using shitty color terminal graphics

You have until lunchtime of next Friday to satisfy these requirements. Probably not enough time to finish
unless you suddenly develop super coding skills. At Friday lunch, if the project is not complet, I will
