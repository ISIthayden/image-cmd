# image-cmd

scans web pages for images and displays them in a terminal

## web scraper command line tool with image viewer, time limited

tool is called from the command line and does this:

- get some list of image urls from the internet
- picks a random image from list
- displays that image to the terminal using shitty color terminal graphics

You have until lunchtime of next Friday to satisfy these requirements. Probably not enough time to finish
unless you suddenly develop super coding skills. At Friday lunch, if the project is not complete, I will
reveal my implementation for you to take hints from.

Teaches: git, loosely defined technical project, http crawling, unix executables, technical writing

# instructions:

1) download image-cmd.py script and store it in an empty working directory
2) using a terminal, navigate to the directory you have stored image-cmd.py in
3) type 'python image-cmd.py' into the command line
4) a url will be requested from the user, and the output will be provided in the terminalfs
